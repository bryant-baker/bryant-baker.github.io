                <p>I'm a California-based GIS professional who's passionate about using geospatial
                data analysis to inform land management and conservation policies locally and abroad. 
                My work focuses on spatial analysis, remote sensing, and building compelling visuals 
                that help people understand our landscapes in meaningful ways.</p>
                <p>As far back as I can remember, I've always loved maps and the unique perspective they 
                give us of this immense, beautiful planet we call home. For over a decade, I've carried 
                that love for maps and the places they represent into my career.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I've mapped everything from wildfire severity in ancient sequoia groves 
                to oil drilling across central and southern California to endangered California condor 
                roosting areas in their current range. I use tools like QGIS, Google Earth Engine, and 
                Python to extract insights and communicate them clearly.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, I enjoy looking for rare plants, photographing landscapes, and spending 
                time with my partner, Gabi, our dog, Leela, and our cat, Kit. </p>
                <p>I'm always interested in new collaborations and meaningful projects.</p>
